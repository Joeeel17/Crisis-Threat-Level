Crisis Threat Level Framework
A dynamic, Excel-based system designed to help crisis teams gauge the severity of a potential or ongoing issue in real time. This framework combines multiple metrics — virality, conversation volume, and sentiment — into a single, actionable threat level that supports timely decision-making and client reporting.

📌 Problem Statement
In crisis monitoring, teams often rely on separate metrics such as engagement or mentions. While useful, these alone do not provide a clear, unified view of how severe a threat truly is — or what next steps to recommend to clients.

Key challenges addressed:
✅ No concise, standard metric to justify threat severity and recommend actions.
✅ Crises are time-sensitive and can escalate rapidly (e.g., viral content with 30M+ views).
✅ Need for a breakdown that clearly shows why a situation is critical and how it should be monitored or escalated.

👤 Role & Contribution
Designed and developed a metric system that:
1. Defines a crisis as any situation that generates or risks generating negative chatter or publicity about a brand online.
2. Integrates key indicators:
	- Virality: Engagement levels on social platforms.
	- Conversation Volume: Mentions and posts.
	- Sentiment: Net sentiment score (balance of positive, neutral, and negative mentions).
3. Created working prototypes of the metric in Excel.
4. Experimented with different statistical approaches (e.g., median, mean) to test reliability.
5. Built a scalable Excel template that can be updated in real time as new data comes in.

⚙️ How It Works
This framework uses fictional data to demonstrate how a real crisis might be scored and tracked.
- Input daily or hourly data for engagement, mentions, and sentiment.
- The tool automatically calculates a weighted threat level.
- Includes breakdowns and thresholds to guide decision-making (e.g., when to escalate to clients).
